abstract: We provide the first provably joint differentially private algorithm with
  formal utility guarantees for the problem of user-level privacy-preserving collaborative
  filtering. Our algorithm is based on the Frank-Wolfe method, and it consistently
  estimates the underlying preference matrix as long as the number of users $m$ is
  $\omega(n^{5/4})$, where $n$ is the number of items, and each user provides her
  preference for at least $\sqrt{n}$ randomly selected items. Along the way, we provide
  an optimal differentially private algorithm for singular vector computation, based
  on the celebrated Ojaâ€™s method, that provides significant savings in terms of space
  and time while operating on sparse matrices. We also empirically evaluate our algorithm
  on a suite of datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
  private algorithms.
